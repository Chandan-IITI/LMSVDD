# Follow the following steps to replicate the results:

1.  To execute above codes, simply open the above codes in MATLAB and run 'Main.m' file. This code will generate results for Gaussian-Polynomial-Polynomial and Gaussian-Polynomial-Linear combination using Softmax gating function for LMSVDD. By changing the parameters, you can obtain the results for other combination of kernel and gating function. 

2. After executing the 'Main.m' file, two files, namely 'gpp_lsoft.mat' and gpl_lsoft.mat.

3. Then execute 'Extract_all_results.m' file. It will yield results of all  mentioned datasets in the paper in the MATLAB workspace.

After following above three steps, you should get excat results as mentioned in paper.
